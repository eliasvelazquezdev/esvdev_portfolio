US based company dedicated to the development of software solutions related to Data Engineering, ETL processes, and web development. Among my daily tasks are:

- **üíª Software solutions development with Python:** Developed software solutions in Python, including a custom permissions framework using Gremlin Python and AWS Neptune for secure access control. Also implemented backend code for a desktop app that allowed users to map and validate CSV data for transformation and storage in a relational database.

- **üîÑ Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes:** Executed data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes by consuming data from APIs and Google Sheets, applying transformations and calculations using Pandas. Designed a scalable and maintainable database schema, ensuring seamless data integration into a relational database.

- **‚òÅÔ∏è Solutions on AWS leveraging various serverless services:** Deployed and managed AWS Lambda functions via the AWS CLI, implementing least privilege permissions to securely access services such as RDS for executing ETL processes. Utilized AWS Step Functions and EventBridge to orchestrate and schedule multiple serverless functions, ensuring timely execution and correct sequencing for efficient data processing in a cloud environment.

- **üó£Ô∏è Communication with clients:** Effectively communicate with clients through written and verbal channels, including text and calls, in English as a non-native speaker, ensuring clear understanding of technical requirements and providing timely solutions.

- **ü§ù Collaborative development:** Work closely with other developers to define and establish tasks through effective communication and teamwork. Regularly seek and offer assistance to ensure smooth project progress. Emphasize the use of clear and detailed Git commit messages to create a robust project log, aiding both my colleagues and my future self in maintaining and contributing to the project efficiently.
