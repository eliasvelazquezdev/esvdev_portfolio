Since February 2024, I‚Äôve been working as a **Data Engineer at [Vordentech](https://www.vordentech.com/)** ‚Äî a full-stack data consulting firm with a global client base. My day-to-day involves solving real-world problems with Python, data pipelines, and a bit of AWS magic. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what I‚Äôve been up to:


### üß† Python & Backend Development  
I‚Äôve developed Python software solutions that solve actual problems ‚Äî not just look pretty in a repo. Highlights include:
- Creating a custom permissions framework using **Gremlin Python** and **AWS Neptune** for fine-grained, secure access control.
- Writing backend logic for a desktop app that lets users map and validate CSV data, transform it, and store it in a relational database without screaming at their screen.

<br>

### üîÑ Data Engineering (ETL Pipelines)  
Built and optimized **ETL pipelines** by consuming data from APIs and Google Sheets, applying logic and transformations with **Pandas**, and designing maintainable database schemas. The result? A **15% boost in processing speed** and cleaner data

<br>

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Solutions (AWS + Snowflake Integration)  
I spend a lot of time in the cloud ‚Äî specifically:
- Orchestrating workflows with **Step Functions** and **EventBridge**, coordinating multiple **Lambda functions** to handle data processing tasks.
- Deploying serverless infrastructure via the **AWS CLI**, always applying the **least privilege principle** because I like my systems secure.
- Developed and delivered a Snowflake infrastructure solution integrating **Python, Lambda, and API Gateway**, reducing security risks by 20% and improving response times. Bonus: finished it before the deadline and got some happy client messages üéØ.
- Lately, I‚Äôve also been collaborating with **Milemarker** through Vordentech, helping them architect a scalable data platform. I refactored their main pipeline for significant **performance and cost improvements**, and created new integrations using **API Gateway + Lambda** to connect several systems to this core pipeline. This has also involved writing technical documents like **Statements of Work (SOW)**, where I present the **business case** and proposed **technical solution** before starting any new project. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to discuss these directly with their CTO ‚Äî which has taught me a lot about bridging tech and business strategy.

<br>

### üó£Ô∏è Client Communication (in English, no less!)  
I work directly with international clients, helping them figure out what they *actually* need (even when they‚Äôre not 100% sure themselves). I communicate clearly via text and voice in **English** (not my native language), making sure requirements are fully understood before building anything. Less guesswork, more solutions.

<br>

### ü§ù Team Collaboration  
I believe tech is a team sport. I work closely with other devs to define tasks, give and receive feedback, and keep things moving forward. I‚Äôm that person who writes **clear, useful Git commit messages** (future me is very thankful), and I regularly review PRs to help maintain high code quality across the board.
