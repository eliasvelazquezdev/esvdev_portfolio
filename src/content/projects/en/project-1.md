subtitle: 'Solo project'
description : "Inspired by sites like Medium and Dev.to, I built this API that allows users to register and log in, publish articles in text format, edit, and delete them. Currently, I'm working on the documentation using Swagger UI and plan to add more features in the future, such as image uploading for user avatars or a system for reactions and comments on the various articles users write. More information can be found in the README of the repository."
