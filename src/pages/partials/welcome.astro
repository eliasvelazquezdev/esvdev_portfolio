    <p class="mb-3">Hey there! If youâ€™ve landed on this page, youâ€™re probably curious about who I am â€” which makes you awesome by default. Let me introduce myself ðŸ‘‡</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Iâ€™m Elias, a Data Engineer (and a few other things) based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I spend my days building data pipelines, wrangling Python code, deploying things on AWS, and talking to APIs like theyâ€™re part of the team.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">I have a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and solving problems with logic (and coffee). I love the terminal â€” seriously, Linux is my comfort zone. Youâ€™ll often find me deep in Pandas, crafting ETL workflows, or deploying serverless stuff with Lambda, API Gateway and crafting storage solutions leveraging RDS or DynamoDB. Iâ€™ve even built a Snowflake infrastructure using Python and AWS services, tackling security challenges and tight deadlines. ðŸ’ª</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Since February 2024, Iâ€™ve been working at Vordentech, a startup with global clients. I communicate with them in English (yep, not my native language!) via voice and text to understand what they need and deliver solutions that actually work. Itâ€™s taught me that clear communication is just as important as clean code.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">I believe collaboration is everything. Whether Iâ€™m reviewing pull requests, asking for help, or organizing events in my WhatsApp tech community (called "ShareIT"), I thrive when I'm learning and building with others. (Fun fact: that community has helped people find jobs, launch projects, and grow in tech. Itâ€™s one of the things Iâ€™m most proud of.)</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Outside of work, I write technical blog posts at <a href="https://esvdev.me">esvdev.me</a>, where I break down complex stuff in a way thatâ€™s (hopefully) helpful and not boring. Sometimes I even make people laugh while talking about pipelines â€” which is peak career satisfaction.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Thanks for reading! If you want to build something cool together, or just say hi, donâ€™t be a stranger.</p>
