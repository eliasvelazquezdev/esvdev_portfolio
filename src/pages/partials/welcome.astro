    <p class="mb-3">Hello there! If you're reading this, you must be a cool person curious about who I am, right? Let me introduce myself! I'm a Junior Data Engineer (among other things) based in <span>Buenos Aires, Argentina</span>, with a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and logical problem-solving, all focused on delivering tangible results.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-3">I have a deep appreciation for the terminalâ€”itâ€™s like my happy placeâ€”so youâ€™ll often find me working away on my trusty Linux machine. Iâ€™m proficient in <span class="font-bold, text-stone-400">Python, SQL, Pandas, and Git</span>, and I love diving into the AWS ecosystem. Services like <span class="font-bold, text-stone-400">Lambda, EC2, ECR, and API Gateway</span> are my playground for building solutions and solving problems. In fact, I'm currently pursuing studies to qualify as an <span class="font-bold, text-stone-400">AWS Solutions Architect</span> ðŸ™Œ.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Details matter to me, especially when it comes to understanding client requirements. <span class="font-bold, text-stone-400">Clear communication and aligning expectations are key to delivering the right solution through code</span>. I also value team collaboration, keeping my colleagues informed about my progress and seeking help when needed. I believe in striking a balance: solving problems independently but knowing when to reach out.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">I enjoy meeting new people and working together to create something great. As of February 2024, Iâ€™m working at a startup with global clients, <span class="font-bold, text-stone-400">communicating with them in English across both written and spoken channels</span>.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">Thanks to my time management and problem-solving skills, I've been able to maintain professionalism while working under pressure and meeting deadlines.</p>

    <p class="mb-3"><span class="font-bold, text-stone-400">I am driven by a continuous desire to expand my skills and adapt to evolving challenges</span>. I unleash my potential when I learn what's necessary to solve problems and meet current needs.</p>
