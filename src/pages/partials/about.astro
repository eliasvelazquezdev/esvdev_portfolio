    <p class="mb-5">After studying nursing for a year and a half and realizing it wasn't for me, in 2021 I decided to revisit a path I briefly explored in high school: programming. I always liked computers and everything you could do with them. At 16, I encountered my first language, <span class="font-bold">C++</span>. I won't sugarcoat it, I hated it. But part of me thought it was like doing magic at the same time. Typing all those weird letters, words, and symbols allowed me to tell the computer what to do (most of the time).</p>

    <p class="mb-5">But that experience remained there. After finishing high school, I started working for several years, and it wasn't until 2021 that I reconnected with this world through my second language: <span class="font-bold">Python</span>. Sure, I didn't remember anything about C++, but I remembered that typing on the computer was something I was already used to (yes, you guessed it: I also "typed" while playing video games, one of my great passions).</p>

    <p class="mb-5">I felt that magic again that I mentioned before. I loved the simplicity of Python's syntax, its readability, and ease of learning. That's how I began this journey where I am a student and most of the time my own teacher, and it's up to this date (September 2023 as I write these lines) that I keep striving to learn and practice what I've learned.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">However, I don't forget the knowledge I gained during my nursing studies. I don't want to delve into the reasons that led me to leave the career, but I do want to discuss the reason why I started: <span class="font-bold">to help others.</span>. If there's something that passionately drives me, it's putting my knowledge at the service of others, regardless of the field or specialty.</p>

    <p class="mb-5">I'm convinced that programming will allow me to do just that. My current goal is to find my place in the IT industry, for which I continuously train and prepare.</p>

    <p class="text-lg font-light italic">Securing my first formal job is just the first of many steps towards achieving my dream: contributing to the community in the healthcare field through technology, combining both worlds.</p>

            <Hobbies 
                hobbieName="🎮 Videogames"
                hobbieDescription="One of my greatest hobbies since I was a little boy. My first console ever was the Super Nintendo (man, feeling old already). Couldn't stop playing Mario Bros, but everything changed the moment I started playing Sonic 1."

            <Hobbies 
                hobbieName="🎹 Music"
                hobbieDescription="For me, life without music isn't life. A total fanatic of '80s and '90s music. Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't born in the wrong era. Besides the computer keyboard, the musical keyboard is my other great passion. Currently, I have three of them, and in fact, you can find me on <a class='text-blue-700' href='https://www.youtube.com/@rj8mp' target='_blank' class='text-decoration-none'>YouTube</a>  making noise with them."

            <Hobbies 
                hobbieName="🎨 Graphic design"
                hobbieDescription="Since I don't have money to pay a graphic designer for my YouTube channel, I decided to take charge of that area, and I admit I've grown fond of the activity. It's not exactly one of my strengths, but in the end, I do it to entertain myself. Although I'm not bad at it either, or at least that's what I want to believe. God bless you, Canva Pro."

            <Hobbies 
                hobbieName="🚶‍♂️ Walking"
                hobbieDescription="Truly, one of the things that relaxes me the most and contributes to my peace of mind. Nothing like a walk in the park to shake off the frustration from the bugs in the current project, from Django and its mysterious errors, or Postman doing its thing (well, not its thing, but I prefer to blame it)."

            <Hobbies 
                hobbieName="📖 Reading"
                hobbieDescription="I don't read as much as I used to. Well, to be more precise, now I read more documentation than physical books. But from time to time, I like to get lost among the pages of some of the books I have on hand. My go-to book? The 12 Rules by the brilliant Jordan Peterson."

            <Hobbies 
                hobbieName="✍ Journaling"
                hobbieDescription="I always found the typical scene of 'Dear diary...' quite amusing. But it turns out there's a certain benefit in writing, in offloading your mind onto paper (physical or digital). In my case, it really clears my head and allows me to express myself. It even helps me think better when it comes to solving a problem. Apart from filling a notebook I have lying around with my thoughts, I also write on my blog, which you can visit <a class='text-blue-700' href='https://esvdev.me' target='_blank' class='text-decoration-none'>with this link</a> (Spanish only at the moment)."
